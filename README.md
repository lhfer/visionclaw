# 🦐 VisionClaw — Your AI Companion on Apple Vision Pro

**English** | [中文](README_CN.md)

**VisionClaw** brings an interactive 3D AI character to your Apple Vision Pro. A lively animated character sits on your desk, listens to your voice, talks back with real speech, and connects to your Mac's AI brain — all in mixed reality.

> *"Like having a tiny AI assistant living on your desk, with personality."*

## ✨ Features

### 🎭 Living 3D Character
- **15+ hand-crafted animations** — idle, listening, thinking, working, celebrating, sleeping, and more
- **Reactive state machine** — the character visually responds to every interaction stage
- **Gesture control** — drag to reposition, pinch to scale, two-hand rotate to turn
- **Always alive** — idle variations, easter egg dances, drowsy yawns, and sleep cycles

### 🎤 Voice Interaction
- **Tap to talk** — tap the character to start listening, tap again to send
- **Real-time transcription** — see your words appear in a floating speech bubble as you speak
- **Chinese speech recognition** — powered by Apple's on-device `SFSpeechRecognizer`
- **Text-to-speech responses** — the character speaks back with natural Chinese TTS

### 💬 AI-Powered Conversations
- **OpenClaw integration** — connects to your Mac Mini running the OpenClaw AI agent via WebSocket
- **Auto-discovery** — finds your Mac on the local network via Bonjour
- **Live status feedback** — see thinking, working, and processing states in real-time
- **Progressive timeout** — clear feedback at 10s, 30s, 60s if the AI takes long

### 🫧 Smart Speech Bubble
- **Typewriter effect** — responses appear character by character with adaptive speed
- **Chinese-optimized** — slower display for Chinese characters, faster for English, pauses on punctuation
- **State icons** — 🎤 listening, ✨ sending, 💭 thinking, ⚙️ working, ✓ success, ⚠️ error
- **Auto-dismiss** — generous reading time calculated for Chinese reading speed (~3 chars/sec)

### 🏠 Spatial Awareness
- **Mixed reality** — character exists in your real environment with shadows
- **Free positioning** — drag the character anywhere in 3D space (horizontal + vertical)
- **Pinch to resize** — scale from tiny (1cm) to large (60cm)
- **Billboard bubble** — speech bubble always faces you automatically

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Apple Vision Pro** (or visionOS Simulator)
- **Xcode 26+** with visionOS 26 SDK
- **Mac Mini** (or any Mac) running the OpenClaw bridge (for AI features)
- **Microphone permission** granted to the app

### 1. Clone & Open

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lhfer/visionclaw.git
cd visionclaw
open ShrimpXR.xcodeproj
```

### 2. Build & Run

1. Select `Apple Vision Pro` target (device or simulator)
2. Build & Run (⌘R)
3. The control panel window appears

### 3. Connect to AI

1. Start the OpenClaw bridge on your Mac:
   ```bash
   cd OpenClawBridge
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python bridge.py
   ```
2. In VisionClaw, tap **"搜索 Mac Mini"** to auto-discover via Bonjour
3. Status turns green when connected

### 4. Meet Your Character

1. Tap **"放出虾虾"** to spawn the character
2. The character appears on your desk with a greeting animation
3. **Tap the character** to start voice input
4. **Speak in Chinese** — see real-time transcription in the bubble
5. **Tap again** to send your message to the AI
6. Watch the character react — casting spell → thinking → celebrating!

### 5. Gesture Controls

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Tap** | Start/stop voice recording |
| **Long press** | Force character upright |
| **Drag** | Move character in 3D space |
| **Pinch** | Scale character size |
| **Two-hand rotate** | Rotate character facing |

## 🎬 Animation States

The character has a rich animation state machine:

| State | Animation | Trigger |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `idle` | Breathing, walking, random poses | Default state |
| `listening` | Focused attention | User taps to speak |
| `sendingCommand` | Casting spell ✨ | Voice input sent |
| `thinking` | Walking/pacing | AI is processing |
| `working` | Active work gestures | AI is executing |
| `success` | Victory dance 🎉 | AI response received |
| `error` | Defeat pose | Something went wrong |
| `sleeping` | Napping 💤 | 2 min inactivity |

## 🛠 Technical Highlights

- **Dual-entity hierarchy**: Wrapper entity (gestures/rotation) → Model entity (animations). Prevents animation root motion from conflicting with user gestures.
- **Async audio setup**: `AVAudioEngine` initialization runs off MainActor via `nonisolated static func` to prevent UI freezing on Vision Pro.
- **ViewAttachmentComponent**: Native visionOS 26 API for rendering SwiftUI directly in 3D space as speech bubbles.
- **BubblePositionComponent**: Custom RealityKit ECS component that dynamically tracks the character's head joint and counter-scales to maintain readable text size regardless of character scale.
- **Swift 6 strict concurrency**: Full compliance with Swift's latest concurrency model.
